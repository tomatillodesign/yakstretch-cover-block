## Field Settings

The block exposes the following ACF fields in the sidebar:

- **Gallery** (Image array)
- **Randomize** (true/false)
- **Content Placement** (`top left`, `center center`, `bottom right`, etc.)
- **Delay** (ms between image switches)
- **Fade Duration** (ms for crossfade)
- **Overlay Style** (`flat`, `gradient`)

## Developer Notes

- CSS follows a layered architecture for theme integration (`@layer components` etc.)
- JavaScript uses fade logic and image preloading to ensure smooth transitions
- The first image loads instantly (no fade) for performance and accessibility
- Editor-side logic handles background rendering via MutationObserver to support live ACF field updates

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add rotation preview toggle in editor
- [ ] Add autoplay pause on hover
- [ ] Add per-image link or caption support
- [ ] Add optional background-blur layer
